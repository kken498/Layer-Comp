# Documentation
The extension was developed within an Anime workflow primarily using After Effects. Some simple compositing was required, which I hoped to accomplish using Blender.
Therefore, the addon's workflow is similar to After Effects. If you've used it before, this will help you better understand the addon.

This addon provides a system and pipeline; it won't provide many more feature node updates in the future. It relies on the user to create their effect presets.

# User Interface
* Drag layer and effect directly

# Future
* Bring the Source Panel back in 5.0
* Support Sequence compositor

# Compatibility
Layer Comp is compatible with older Blender versions, starting from Blender 4.2. But the best use of the addon is the least version, some features and nodes aren't available in 4.4 or below.

Legacy and 5.0 compositor systems cannot be used in the same project.

The Legacy Compositor System may not fully function in all its features in version 5.0 or higher. It is recommended to use the 5.0 system with the latest update.

The future update will no longer cover the legacy compositor system.
